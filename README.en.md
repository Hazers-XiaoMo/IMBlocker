# IMBlocker

## About

IMBlocker is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod that automatically switch your input method on/off.

When playing Minecraft, you close input method for playing and open input method for chatting. Switching input method frequently makes you annoyed.

That's why we need IMBlocker, who can detect the game's current state and switch input method for you.

## How it works

- How Minecraft Processes inputs
    - Minecraft calls **both** *key input* processing and *char input* processing every time we input
    - *key input* is not what we care
    - *char input* is dispatched to Minecraft's current GUI `Screen`, which then usually delegates down to a `TextFieldWidget` somewhere
    - Normally a `TextFieldWidget` reacts for this input, but when GUI `Screen` does not exist, they decided not to call delegate, or the `TextFieldWidget` is not active, nothing would react
    - Whether reacted or not, the *char input* processing is called
    - We can't find out if the game would like to receive out *char input*
- How IMBlocker detect *char input* state
    - We find out **all of** `TextFieldWidget`s
    - We use ASM hacking its constructor to accomplish that
    - If any `TextFieldWidget` accepts *char input*, we believe the game accepts it
- Special cases
    - Some `Screen`s like *Book and Quill* and *Sign* directly receive input, rather than redirecting it to `TextFieldWidget`s
    - We can't capture their inputs, so we make a whitelist for them
- Limits
    - One `TextFieldWidget` can accept *char input*, but the game may not call him with real inputs
    - On Platforms other than *Windows* we don't know how to disable/enable input methods
    - Suggestions and feedbacks are welcomed
